Some RLE type compression

Header (4 bytes): Unknown (Possibly related to the decompressed data size)

Then, the image data, which consists in several 5 bytes blocks. It ends when encountering a block filled with 0s, or when the end of file is reached

For each 5 bytes block:

byte 0: number of pixels using the color described in the block
byte 1-3: color in RGB format
byte 4: always 0x80, possibly related to the alpha channel

For example, this data
05 FF FF FF 80 08 00 00 00 80
will be decompressed as 5 white pixels (1st block) followed by 8 black pixels (2nd block)

Notes: 
It should be linked to some map data, as the image data is split into several parts:

each part consumes image_part_width*image_part_height pixels from the decompressed data
(image_part_width, image_part_height, image_part_xpos, image_part_ypos)

For both files provided those parts are:
(256,256,0,0)
(256,256,256,0)
(128,256,512,0)
(256,128,0,256)
(256,128,256,256)
(128,128,512,256)
(256,64,0,384)
(256,64,256,384)
(128,64,512,384)
